# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project was to understand unsupervised learning and how to porcess data.
I learned how to cluster reduce the principal component by using PCA, reduce dimensions and 
compile them together and reate an analysis for a client in the cryptocurrency market. 
I was able to put my results into a clustering algorithm and use data visualization to share with the board.
